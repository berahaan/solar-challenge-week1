Solar Data Discovery
Kickstart Your AI Mastery with Cross-Country Solar Farm Analysis
Challenge Overview
This week’s challenge is focused on understanding, exploring, and analyzing solar farm data found in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The challenge aims to evaluate candidates for the 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).

Applicants who proceed to the next level by demonstrating sufficient performance in this week's challenge will have a clear picture of the required discipline, resilience, proactivity, talent diversity, and other essential elements of the 10 Academy training. Those who can not make it to the limited spots available will gain a clear understanding of the direction they should improve to prepare for FA, DE & MLE job positions in the future. Everyone will gain project experience to showcase in their professional profile.

This week, therefore, is a win-win for everyone. We advise you to put your best effort into completing as many tasks as possible. We know that the number of tasks you are required to complete is a lot, and you will not have time to build intuition or to be comfortable with the new concepts and skills you are exposed to with this week’s challenge. Please note that building a deeper understanding is not the purpose for this week's project. Moreover, you may have never done or attempted to do some of the tasks before this training. If you are confused and overwhelmed, know that it is expected.

The tutors, community managers, and all other teams are there to support you as best as they can. Be proactive in asking questions, provide resources that may help others, and above all persist!

Business Objective
MoonLight Energy Solutions aims to develop a strategic approach to significantly enhance its operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. As an Analytics Engineer at MoonLight Energy Solutions, your task is to perform a quick analysis of an environmental measurement provided by the engineering team and translate your observation as a strategy report. Your analysis should focus on identifying key trends and learn valuable insights that will support your data-driven case - your recommendation based on the statistical analysis and EDA. In particular, your analysis and recommendation must present a strategy focusing on identifying high-potential regions for solar installation that align with the company's long-term sustainability goals. Your report should provide an insight to help realize the overarching objectives of MoonLight Energy Solutions.

Dataset Overview
The data for this week's challenge is extracted and aggregated from Solar Radiation Measurement Data. Each row in the data contains the values for solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction, cleaned and soiled radiance sensor (soiling measurement), and cleaning events.

. The structure of the data is as follows

Timestamp (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm): Date and time of each observation.
GHI (W/m²): Global Horizontal Irradiance, the total solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface.
DNI (W/m²): Direct Normal Irradiance, the amount of solar radiation received per square meter on a surface perpendicular to the rays of the sun.
DHI (W/m²): Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance, solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun.
ModA (W/m²): Measurements from a module or sensor (A), similar to irradiance.
ModB (W/m²): Measurements from a module or sensor (B), similar to irradiance.
Tamb (°C): Ambient Temperature in degrees Celsius.
RH (%): Relative Humidity as a percentage of moisture in the air.
WS (m/s): Wind Speed in meters per second.
WSgust (m/s): Maximum Wind Gust Speed in meters per second.
WSstdev (m/s): Standard Deviation of Wind Speed, indicating variability.
WD (°N (to east)): Wind Direction in degrees from north.
WDstdev: Standard Deviation of Wind Direction, showing directional variability.
BP (hPa): Barometric Pressure in hectopascals.
Cleaning (1 or 0): Signifying whether cleaning (possibly of the modules or sensors) occurred.
Precipitation (mm/min): Precipitation rate measured in millimeters per minute.
TModA (°C): Temperature of Module A in degrees Celsius.
TModB (°C): Temperature of Module B in degrees Celsius.
Comments: This column is designed for any additional notes.

Branching & Commits
Create a branch called setup-task.
Commit at least 3 times with messages like “init: add .gitignore”, “chore: venv setup”, “ci: add GitHub Actions workflow”
.gitignore (include data/ and any .csv/.ipynb_checkpoints/)
requirements.txt
GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that runs pip install -r requirements.txt.
Basic CI
Add a GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that runs python --version or pip install -r requirements.txt.
README
In README.md, document how to reproduce the environment:
Merge setup-task into main via a Pull Request.

Task 2: Data Profiling, Cleaning & EDA
Objective: Profile, clean, and explore each country’s solar dataset end-to-end so it’s ready for comparison and region-ranking tasks.

Create branch: eda- (e.g. eda-benin)

Notebook: _eda.ipynb

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) analysis on the following:

Summary Statistics & Missing-Value Report
df.describe() on all numeric columns., df.isna().sum() and list any column with >5% nulls.
Outlier Detection & Basic Cleaning
Look for missing values, outliers, or incorrect entries, especially in columns like GHI, DNI, and DHI and check for outliers, especially in sensor readings (ModA, ModB) and wind speed data (WS, WSgust).
Compute Z-scores for GHI, DNI, DHI, ModA, ModB, WS, WSgust; flag rows with |Z|>3.
Drop or impute (median) missing values in key columns.
Export cleaned DataFrame to data/_clean.csv (ensure data/ is in .gitignore and never commit CSVs).
Time Series Analysis
Line or bar charts of GHI, DNI, DHI, Tamb vs. Timestamp.
Observe patterns by month, trends throughout day, or anomalies, such as peaks in solar irradiance or temperature fluctuations.
Cleaning Impact
Group by Cleaning flag and plot average ModA & ModB pre/post-clean.
Correlation & Relationship Analysis
Heatmap of correlations (GHI, DNI, DHI, TModA, TModB).
Scatter plots: WS, WSgust, WD vs. GHI; RH vs. Tamb or RH vs. GHI.
Wind & Distribution Analysis
Wind rose or radial bar plot of WS/WD.
Histograms for GHI and one other variable (e.g. WS).
Temperature Analysis
Examine how relative humidity (RH) might influence temperature readings and solar radiation.
Bubble Chart
GHI vs. Tamb with bubble size = RH or BP.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Metric Comparison
Boxplots of GHI, DNI, DHI side-by-side (one plot per metric, colored by country).
Summary Table comparing mean, median, and standard deviation of GHI, DNI, DHI across countries.
Statistical Testing (optional but recommended)
Run a one-way ANOVA (or Kruskal–Wallis) on GHI values to assess whether differences between countries are significant.
Briefly note p-values.
Key Observations
A markdown cell with 3 bullet points summarizing what stands out (e.g., “Country X shows highest median GHI but also greatest variability”).
(Bonus) Visual Summary
A small bar chart ranking countries by average GHI.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Inclusion of all three countries in each plot
Correct implementation and reporting of p-values
